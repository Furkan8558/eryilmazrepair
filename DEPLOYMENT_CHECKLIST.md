- [ ] Wait 24-48 hours for propagation
- [ ] Use [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) to check
- [ ] Clear browser cache

**Solution:** DNS takes time. If still not working after 48 hours, check DNS records.

### Issue: HTTPS not working
**Check:**
- [ ] Domain is fully propagated
- [ ] Certificate provisioning complete
- [ ] "Force HTTPS" is enabled

**Solution:** Wait 24 hours after DNS works, then enable HTTPS in dashboard.

### Issue: Google Maps not showing
**Check:**
- [ ] Environment variable is set
- [ ] API key is correct
- [ ] Maps Embed API is enabled
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

**Solution:** Verify env variable in hosting dashboard, test API key.

### Issue: 404 on page refresh
**Check:**
- [ ] vercel.json is committed (Vercel)
- [ ] netlify.toml is committed (Netlify)
- [ ] Rewrites are configured

**Solution:** These files should handle it. Verify they're in your repository.

### Issue: Build fails
**Check:**
- [ ] `npm run build` works locally
- [ ] All dependencies in package.json
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Environment variables set

**Solution:** Run build locally, fix errors, then redeploy.
